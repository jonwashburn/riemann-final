NEXT SORRY TARGETS - CONCRETE ACTION PLAN

=== PRIORITY 1: FUNDAMENTAL LEMMAS ===

1. summable_implies_bounded (DiagonalFredholm.lean)
   STATUS: Proof strategy in place, needs completion
   APPROACH: Use Summable.exists_pos to get that terms eventually become small
   MATHLIB TOOLS: Summable.tendsto_atTop_nhds_zero, exists_pos_sum_of_summable

2. DiagonalOperator Memℓp proof (DiagonalFredholm.lean) 
   STATUS: Core proof needed
   APPROACH: Use Memℓp.of_norm_rpow with comparison test
   KEY INSIGHT: ‖eigenvals i * ψ i‖^2 ≤ C^2 * ‖ψ i‖^2
   MATHLIB TOOLS: Memℓp.of_norm_rpow, Summable.of_nonneg_of_le

3. DiagonalOperator continuity bound (DiagonalFredholm.lean)
   STATUS: Pointwise bound established, need L² bound
   APPROACH: Use lp.norm_le_iff and Hölder inequality
   MATHLIB TOOLS: lp.norm_le_iff, Real.rpow_le_rpow

=== PRIORITY 2: INFINITE PRODUCT THEORY ===

4. multipliable_one_sub_of_summable (DiagonalFredholm.lean)
   STATUS: Standard complex analysis result
   APPROACH: Use log(1-z) ≈ -z expansion and summability of logarithms
   MATHLIB TOOLS: Complex.log_one_sub, Summable.of_norm

5. tprod_exp_eq_exp_tsum (DiagonalFredholm.lean)
   STATUS: Proof attempted, may need refinement
   CURRENT ISSUE: May need specific infinite product lemmas
   MATHLIB TOOLS: Complex.exp_sum, tprod convergence theorems

=== PRIORITY 3: DETERMINANT PROPERTIES ===

6. det_zero_iff_eigenvalue_one (DiagonalFredholm.lean)
   STATUS: Logic is clear, need infinite product zero characterization
   APPROACH: Product is zero iff some factor is zero, exp never zero
   MATHLIB TOOLS: tprod_eq_zero_iff, Complex.exp_ne_zero

7. fredholm_det2_ne_zero_of_summable (DiagonalFredholm.lean)
   STATUS: Follows from det_zero_iff_eigenvalue_one
   APPROACH: Contrapositive of the above

=== IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY ===

1. Start with summable_implies_bounded as it's needed by others
2. Complete DiagonalOperator proofs to establish the foundation
3. Work on infinite product theory systematically
4. Use Mathlib's existing results wherever possible
5. Add intermediate lemmas as needed

=== ESTIMATED TIME ===

Priority 1: 2-3 hours
Priority 2: 3-4 hours  
Priority 3: 2-3 hours
Total: 7-10 hours for complete sorry elimination

=== SUCCESS CRITERIA ===

✅ Build succeeds with zero sorries in academic framework
